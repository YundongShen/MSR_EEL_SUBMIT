"""Match generated hunks against the reference patch and assign Tier 1 / 2 / 3.

The reference patch is used here and nowhere else in the candidate pipeline: it decides
which generated hunks are retained.

  - A generated hunk is retained (Tier 1/2) when some reference hunk in the same file
    starts within ``MATCH_TOLERANCE`` lines of it (position only, content is not compared).
  - Otherwise it is non-retained (Tier 3).
  - A retained hunk is Tier 1 when its file is statically linked to a fail-to-pass test,
    Tier 2 otherwise (heuristic in data.tier_labeler).
